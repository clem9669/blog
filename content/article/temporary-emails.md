In this article, I will present you a brief comparison of my top 4 *temporary email providers*.

<!--more-->

When testing email server or for creating account, you always need at least 4 mail accounts:
- one for the original account because you don't want to use your personnal email
- two for the second account for checking lateral priv
- tree for the priviledge account
- four for checking the priviledge account priv
and why not even more !


## TLDR; Ranking

> All the email providers showcased need JS.

1. https://dropmail.me 
2. https://www.trash-mail.com
3. https://www.guerrillamail.com
4. https://maildrop.cc


## Assessment criterion

Therefore, the selection is based on the following requirements:
1. Ease to create email box
2. Ease of use and reuse
3. Reliable / Fast
4. Nice css would be a plus

## Dropmail.me

> https://dropmail.me

This is my favorite. It has a nice UI. It is fast and clear. Have a tons of domains.

You can extend on assigned domain as follow:
```
mlzaekrk.whatever@whatever.emlpro.com
mlzaekrk.whatever1@3whatever.emlpro.com
mlzaekrk.whatever2@2whatever.emlpro.com
mlzaekrk.whatever3@1whatever.emlpro.com
```
You can add domains at will:

- It has **no time limit**, it dies when you close the browser or refresh (careful)
- It has to option to forward all input to other email address.
- It can alert you with *notification* with or without sound, *viber* or *telegram*.
- It handles mail attachments
- Nobody can recover your previous mail box except you if **you** choose to thanks to the generated password. 
- You can recover all inbox but not the mail previously received.
- The site is available in lots of language.

## Trash-mail.com

Trash-mail is an alternative to *dropmail.me*.

You have to generate the user account on your own.
It offers a plus, because you can send mail.

## Guerrillamail.com

Ugly, old but has almost the same features as both previous.

## Maildrop.cc

The simpliest. When security is none of your concern, you can use [maildrop.cc](https://maildrop.cc) or equivalent. This an open malbox without password and that can be recover by anyone.

https://temp-mail.org/ is similar and has a qrcode feature ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

# Conclusion

Dropmail is the hoyl grail.
If it goes down,a good backup solution is trash-mail.com.
